# 🚗 Car Data Analysis with Python

This project explores a comprehensive car dataset using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. It includes data cleaning, statistical summaries, visualizations, and predictive modeling (linear regression) to derive insights into car features such as MSRP, horsepower, fuel efficiency, and more.

## 📊 Key Features

- Missing value analysis and summary stats  
- Grouped analysis by car origin and type  
- Price segmentation: Budget, Mid-Range, Luxury  
- Power-to-weight ratio computation  
- Predictive modeling using linear regression (MSRP vs Horsepower)  
- Data visualizations: bar chart, scatter plot, pie chart  
- NumPy-powered stats: normalization, std dev, mean filtering
